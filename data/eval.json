But I wouldn\u2019t follow people\u2019s advice about telling your friend that you sold it for more then you paid and then taking him out for pizza or whatever, your friend might be insulted since you profited and all they got was a pizza.   If you want to sell it just tell your friend you gifted it to a younger family member and you\u2019ll be fine.

I hope some day that will be the case for you.  As for the game technically it performs really well, so maybe its a glitch or recent patch causing it.

You need to grow up dude.","158":"Put them on an alternate linup, and loose games(put the controller down and go do chores), and get lower divisions so the game actually is hockey, not the sweaty ragg and right analog smashing top division plays.

I'm completely incompetent and I ended up with 5 or so","166":"I have a friend that had the operation as an adult and he says it\u2019s a blessing to those that were circumcised at birth. Without being graphic, it sounds like a pain in the ass hygienically.   Having said that, my buddy recovered rather quickly after the procedure and did not complain too much of the pain. In reality it probably is better to be circumcised, but I agree with you, it\u2019s our body and ultimately that should be a choice we make, not our parents.","167":"Arms warrior, you'll be doing mediocre damage in pve anyway even if you wanted to go with your actual 2nd best secondary stat but verse isn't far behind that.

Why are you guys so obsessed with silencing any opposition?","172":"This is illegal you know.","173":"In Portland, stay away from Deering Oaks and Hadlock Field (specifially Grant Street, Park Ave, and St Johns Street).

You seem worried about hollywood actors we just seen a russian Puppet president try to become a dictator. You not awake you been a sleep at the wheel while the russia agent has been brainwashing you.","182":"Crystal tower is the worst content in the game. I'm so glad it's mostly gone, and this event reminded me why. It's so tedious to have to build 6 completely separate parties, it's not challenging enough to be actually interesting, but if they made it challenging enough to lose it would be even more miserable because of having to redo the entire thing.  At least this time I liked it better than the old ones because of the extra abilities each fight granted, so it got easier as you use up your characters.","183":"It would be suicide, since they killed themself before the poison you put in their body could kill them.","184":"if you could be able to escape pandemic, where do you want to end up? in bandemic or in panoramic?","185":"You did not mention what I think is most important feature.

I\u2019m in my forties and have seen so many changes in the almost 30 years of TV work I\u2019ve done. This profession has gone from well paid skilled work, to something a 12 year old can do in their bedroom. There\u2019s not much money in it anymore unless you reach a certain pinnacle.

No one plays them after the first week, unless they give crazy rewards. From the last several years, only a couple of events were so interesting that you could still play them longer than a week - maybe only Aghanims labyrinth and Underhollow.

All they're doing is changing from paying you in advance to paying at the end of a pay period.   The \"in case you quit\" part likely means they were having an issue with people quitting on the spot (no two week notice) right after being paid for the next two weeks.","453":"You can thank Everton and Richarlison for his lack of play.

It has been amazing watching the Wrestling world come together. I don't think WWE is going to play a tribute video like many believe, he will get a graphic for sure. I imagine there will be some wrestlers who do a call out tonight and this week on WWE tv, whether its his moves, maybe an armband or dropping \"...you know what that means\" or a \"yeah yeah yeah yeah\" into a promo","490":"No. It's balanced as it is. The idea that Venti makes the game more at ease is already an advantage. Having to aim the ult makes it unfair. His burst is amazing that it wouldn't hurt failing 1 out of 10 burst.  Maybe you need to work on your aim. It's harder to use Venti in mobile now you want them to aim his burst? C'mon.","491":"Ok I don't f-ing care if yall don't agree but hydro right now really doesn't need a buff. Like actually why would it need a buff?!  Hydro is besides pyro the strongest element in the game and fr the elements all serve different purposes. Just let hydro boost you healing.  Comparing it to the geo resonance buff is laughable. Unlike hydro geo is the worst element and will stay the worst even with the buffs.","492":"Change my mind you dirty fucks who ever thinks socialists is the way to go I hope a donkey fucks every single one of your wives and daughters.

Tua has been ineffective this season. The hope is with an offseason of non-rehab, he turns it around. However, add in Tua's injury history, I think it would be risky to put all your eggs in the Tua basket. I don't want to go back to Fitz.   If Tua shows to be ineffective or injured, you have an amazing prospect in Fields to step in. If Tua crushes it, you can always trade Fields for a 1st rounder or more.","495":"What do you mean other country?

A chunk of this fan base either didn't live through the 90's or chooses not to remember.","521":"You think them fixing an 8mb limit is promising and them listening? That's something that in recent times has never been an issue. Idk I have over 70 hours in it, feels more like a slap in the face.","522":"It's normal to want to have your own biological children.

He E blossoms do not proc on hits on shielded enemies, a huge flaw. Test the cryo slime and abyss mages.  His particle generation is random, and sometimes I got 2 particles instead of one, and 0 at other times.  His ult interaction with his E is entirely random, and does not have any focus on first testing. Ulted 5 enemies at once, and most whiffed. Ulted two, same result.  He seems like a bad character so far.

Then purchase coins. The next step is tricky. Use those coins for incubators. At this point you will have earned some incubators to use to hatch eggs.   In all seriousness, even asking for a way to earn incubators is asking for something free.

I'd suggest calling ahead to be sure","551":"This actually didn\u2019t end that badly. It\u2019s not morally right, but a bunch of stores in my district did something similar after we came up off lockdown. From a business perspective it makes a lot of sense. You want the product, we have the product. If you don\u2019t like the price go elsewhere. If it keeps the lights on and my team fed, so be it. People who want it badly enough will certainly pay.","552":"Okay these are serious questions, and im not just trying to fight with people on this sub. But why do you believe in astrology?

You don't text again to see what's up. You don't call them out. You just move on and date other people.  If they are interested, they will get back to you. Or you could calm the fuck down and relax, and try her again in a couple weeks.  I regularly sleep with hot girls who flake on me by pinging them a while after the flake.

In survivor mode, if you quit or shutdown the game after \"Defeat\" appears then the weapons used are not marked as \"broken\".

I lose weight, but it\u2019s very slow and I want it to be faster. Fastest way to lose weight... full proof... eat less and move more. Doesn\u2019t matter what you eat... but try to limit the total calories you consume daily... also drink water only... no juice... coffee... sodas etc. But diet + exercise is the way... can\u2019t have one without the other (in an engage way)","266":"Anywhere to sell expensive-ish unopened bottles of liquor in Calgary?

So the cards for these games are weird. I checked the sleeve your games site and followed their recommendations but these cards seem oddly sized. What sleeves work best?  Also sleeving The Mind clearly is too much for the box. Is the a good deck box you'd recommend for the deck? I love the game and usually refuse to store a game out of the box, but these cards are getting worn from so much play My main question is, why? The Mind is $15 MSRP, and cheaper online, it will literally cost you more for a good deck box and good sleeves than it will to replace the game if\/when it eventually wears out. There\u2019s a fairly similar argument although it\u2019s MSRP is slightly higher than sleeves are, but since you need the sheets, and refills of those are pretty much only available from the publisher, it seems more cost effective to just replace the game.

If someone flakes, it's a sign they're not really interested and don't even respect you enough to just tell you. So how about we follow this simple rule. If someone flakes on you, you move on. You don't text again to see what's up. You don't call them out. You just move on and date other people.  If they are interested, they will get back to you. Or you could calm the fuck down and relax, and try her again in a couple weeks.  I regularly sleep with hot girls who flake on me by pinging them a while after the flake. I lose nothing, and gain some of the most mind-blowing nights of my life by not being so black and white about everything in your life.  She's not going to get back to you if she's a hot girl.
