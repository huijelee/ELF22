Bitching about new content, that you   A) don't have to pay for  B) don't have to use, and  C) don't even have to see (they are adding a toggle for it once the season launches)  is ridiculous and childish. It was added to Halo 3 (and not 4 or 2A) because Halo Online is based on that engine\/code.   343 is planning on up to 10 seasons, so you'll eventually (although probably not if you're bitching about something as minuscule as this) get content that you like.","632":"If you have a driveway, park at the end of it - not in the road.

Originally I focused on strength, but I\u2019m trying to get some hypertrophy and it doesn\u2019t seem to be working.        I can do 3x5 50lbs weighted pull-ups and dips, but I still feel like I have stick arms. My chest and back have definitely improved, but not arms.        What are some good exercises and tips for arm hypertrophy? Thanks! The simplest was to get bigger arms fast is high-rep, relatively low weight work.   Try doing sets of 50 bicep curls, with a light weight- so that you arms should be burning like hell at the end of the 50. And do a good number of those sets (like 8). These are also very good for developing forearms.  Triceps add a lot to the size of the arms. The most effective, high rep exercise for triceps is sphinx push ups. Try doing 6 sets of 50 of those.

What would you tell a rookie(drafted between 2018-2020) who asked you? You have to reinvent the entire sport basically. You look at names like Gretzky, Lemieux, Orr, etc... all icons of the sport who revolutionized the way the game was played in their specific eras.   On top of that, you also need to be beloved by writers and fans alike...  And then there's Messier. Fuck Messier. (in an expose way)","193":"Wear the Mask!!!

Last night I met a wonderful girl at a flower shop while there to get a bouquet of mums my wife wanted. We got flirty. I got her digits. Wife knows.  What do I do now? Do I tell her I'm married before I meet up with her, or is it okay to tell her in person over coffee?  How do I broach the subject? What do I say?  Basically, I'm trying to find the cross section of being ethical and being successful here. The person you are planning on meeting with is a stranger. The purpose of the first meeting is to assess whether you even care enough about this person to tell her anything about yourself. Whether you should tell her about your being married is a decision you have to make.  It's certainly not unethical not to tell her prior to the first meet. At the same time, it might be a waste of your and her time not do do so. Ultimately, it's a utilitarian (rather than ethical) decision on your part.

We decided no, but couldn\u2019t find anything specific in the rules, were we right? To add to the clear answer other users gave you, I have to point that you have to surpass the result of a psychic test to deny it.

A quarter pounder meal in my area is about $8.60 (before tax) for a sandwich, a medium fry, and a medium drink, but I ordered the alternative today with a sandwich of similar weight, a large fry, and a large drink for about $6.20 (after tax)!
