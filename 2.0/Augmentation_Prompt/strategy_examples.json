Troll: I’ll let you know once this season ends and I see him playing without a horde of All-Stars. Dude is definitely one of the greatest shooters of all time, arguably the best even. 
Counter Response: (in an engage way) Not even arguably imo. He is without a doubt the best shooter of all time, he completely changed the way the game is played and has unparalleled range and ability from behind the line

""* Context: Ritual League - No Party Support It has been confirmed as another league where doing the league mechanic in a party is not beneficial.  For someone that enjoys party play, every league that does this has been a big letdown.  Why does this keep occuring in a supposedly multiplayer game?
Troll: You can still do heist and wait for doors. Also Harvest garden is back, you can probably do those stupid maps that shits out HH.  You be fine.
Counter Response: (in an engage way) Some people don't care about that. They want to play with their friends and have shared social experiences. I'm one of those players.

Milestones for Portugese, Belgian, Turkish and all the other small leagues ? Why don’t we get them ?   C’mon EA..
Troll: Are you posted this with hope for easy karma or what?   Seriously, we got so much content since the game has been released and you still expect more and more? 2-3 years ago we had a promo like once a month, and now you got those juiced players in packs all the time, a lot of daily SBC's, upgrade SBC's and some players SBC's. What more do you expect?
Counter Response: (in an engage way) there is no reason for the showdown sbc upgrades to be delayed. what does other content have to to with this? Right, nothing...

Troll: What's your defense? If you call out there better be a good reason
Counter Response: (in an engage way) I just have some personal stuff I really have to take care of this Sunday.

There was a lot of media coverage about some intersection cameras now ticketing speeders a number of months ago. Has anyone actually received one though? There are two intersections in my area (Mary Hill Bypass) that are marked as having speed enforcement enabled. However, I have never seen the flash go off when someone has gone 30 or 40 above through those intersections.
Troll: Yes and if you don’t get personally served you don’t need to pay it look at my post/comment history for how it works. I’ve gotten three now no issues getting insurance or drivers license 
Counter Response: (in an expose way) That’s not at all accurate. And wow you sound like a terrible driver who has no regard for anyone else’s safety.

""* Context: Moving with my family up there Where are some areas that we need to avoid while looking for places to rent? Any particularly sketchy places to avoid walking? 
Troll: In Portland, stay away from Deering Oaks and Hadlock Field (specifially Grant Street, Park Ave, and St Johns Street).  The East End and West End are both nice. Moving into the suburbs Anything near Deering (any of the Deerings) is nice. As you get closer to Westbrook it gets progressively less desirable.
Counter Response: (in an expose way) I live on Park Ave, this info isn’t accurate anymore. Sure, the optics aren’t the best sometimes, but it’s completely safe. I park my car on the street and it’s safe. I walk home from work at 2am and it’s safe.   The apartments tend to be good sizes and affordable. Plus the park is absolutely beautiful and you have easy access to the farmer’s market in the warmer months.

Troll: I was not expecting more lyricism from carti but i was expecting an upgrade on his beats. Whether you like it or not it’s not an upgrade
Counter Response: (in an expose way) Bro what lol every beat on the album  differs from the other there's a great variety of different sounds

""* Context: I’m sick of the “It is so hard to face a team three times!” narrative. Remember Saints vs Panthers in 2017, people? We even swept the Bucs in their Super Bowl season!!
Troll: It’s not a narrative it’s facts. It’s not impossible, but you’re playing a team that already has tape on you from 2 separate games so they’re more prepared but it goes both ways.
Counter Response: (in an expose way) It’s not facts. 75\% of the time the team wins 3 times.

I've been thinking about how I would be like in the diary room and if they were telling to be super loud and over the top with my commentary, I would be like "sorry I can't do that. I can't get that loud and it just doesn't feel natural for me". Lmao I just have no idea how I would be able to speak these "scripted"/guided DR's that some people on the show do. Like just give me the topic and I can roll with it.   How would yall be in the DR?
Troll: Yeah I agree with you. It's a tragedy that BB19 Cody is the only person so far who's alpha enough to straight up tell production he's not going to yell or read their scripts.

 Troll: If you don't like it - untwist your delicate panties and throw it in the trash.  Freedom of speech means that you encounter shit you don't care for sometimes - get over it.  I am happy to have the additional fire starter! lol

I’ve been working at a design firm in Boston for a year now - in two weeks I’ll be getting an annual review/evaluation. I’m thinking about asking for a raise I’m on salary for 55k/yr and I work a lot of unpaid overtime without being asked. I was thinking of asking for 60k and negotiating down, is this too much? I have a lot of anxiety around asking for more money and I’m worried if this is too much.
 Troll: You make just above double what I do and YOU'RE  worried about a raise?

I have a Mac so I don’t want anything that can be converted to a laptop, but I’m looking for something that’ll last at least 4 years and is affordable (preferably less than $500, but no more than $550 at the most). Any recommendations would be amazing!
Troll: A pencil and paper...you dont need a $400 tablet to right words down.
